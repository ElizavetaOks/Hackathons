Elizaveta and Anna: System to find events for jwish communities
The project is simple, with just one file and one template, but is functional
and yet you could implement many concepts that we learned: OOP (including decorators)
a very popular and useful module in python: Flask, and finally: Databases.
The page is not user friendly yet but you already have the logic and functionality that are the most important.
I would advice you to keep working in this project in the future, to share it in your portfolio after some review and design to display the information.
Also you can consider to use a API to add the data, not manually as you did.

Python OOP:9/10
Modules: 7/10
Database:9/10
JSON/API:5/10
Overall: 7.5
